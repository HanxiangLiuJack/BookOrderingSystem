## Retrospective
### After the retrospective activity in Iteration 2, we found the book id and account id of our project (UMUTOS) was not as successful as we desired. In Iteration 1, we used a static integer variable in both book and account class to assign the ID, but when we transform to HSQLDB, it becomes a problem. When this problem appeared, we have no idea how to solve, it becomes a bottleneck. After search and trying, we finally implement max id in database, the variable is incremented when a new book or new account been created. Although it works, it is not a wise way to solve this problem. 
### Through the deeper level study of HSQLDB and get helped by instructor, we find a new way to solve this problem, and compared to the previously one, it easier to use and more efficiency. In this Iteration, we are going to use ‘IDENTITY’ in HSQLDB to get these IDs. We will add the key word ‘IDENTITY’ in front of the PRIMARY KEY of BOOK and ACCOUNT table, and the id of book and account will be created each time when we add a new book or account and increment automatically started from 0. After fix, if the id of books and accounts works well (we can use book id and account id), every time user register a new book or new user sign up, the book id and account id will increment automatically, then we can decide this change is succeed.

### According to the chart, it is obviously that compared to the Iteration 2, the actual cost is more closed to the estimate cost in the Iteration 3. In Iteration 2, we are not very familiar with HSQLDB, so we give some extra time to write database, but we still missed a lot of details, and then go back to solve those problems just before the due time. The most extra time we cost because of book id and account id, but is still in our estimate time. When it comes to this iteration, we are much more familiar with HSQLDB, so we can estimate the cost more accurately.
### After all, according to this project, we have more comprehensive understanding of android application, and 3-tier architecture. We are making progress iteration by iteration, and know the importance of team work. Practice is always the best teacher, and this project will be a milestone along the way.
